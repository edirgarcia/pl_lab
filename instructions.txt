PyTorch Lightning Workshop.

Come and create a VM.

Then use VSCode where it says:

JupyterLab Jupyter VsCode, launch VsCode and login.

Navigate to Users directory
cd Users
(ls) make sure your alias exists...
if for whatever reason does not exist create it: mkdir <alias>   ->    rm -d <alias> to delete

Navigate yo your directory
cd <alias>

Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/edirgarcia/pl_lab.git

Navigate to the pl_lab directory:
cd pl_lab

Here regular PyTorch trainer should run...

What are we gonna do anyways?

Install lightning:
pip install pytorch-lightning

there's a weird bug so please run.
pip install -U horovod

Now, get to porting it over to lightning.

Are you an overacheiver, Experiment with Trainer() parameters, make your network convolutional.
